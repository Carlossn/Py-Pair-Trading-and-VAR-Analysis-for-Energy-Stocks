# The folder contains diverse files and documents produced by Carlos Salas Najera
# for the completion of the CQF final project.

### Quick Use Recommendation
# The recommended approach is to read the pdf report "Carlos_Salas_CQF_Project_Report.pdf"
# and staet inspecting the materials opening the jupyter notebook "CQF_Carlos_Salas_Project_Notebook.ipynb"
# as the latter contains a progressive walk through the pdf document tables and charts as well as 
# links to the different libraries and files imported.
#
